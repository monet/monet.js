For people who wish they didn't have to programme in JavaScript. Full documentation at http://cwmyers.github.com/monet.js/


## Introduction

Monet is a library designed to bring great power to your JavaScript programming. It is a tool bag that assists Functional Programming by providing a rich set of Monads and other useful functions.

This library is inspired by those that have come before, especially the [FunctionalJava][functionalJava] and [Scalaz][scalaz] projects.

While functional programming may be alien to you, this library is a simple way to introduce monads and pure functional programming into your daily practises.

## Documentation

Full detailed documentation can be found [here](docs/README.md)

## Download

Download the [zip][gitZip] or [tar][gitTar] ball.

## Source code

The source is available at: [http://github.com/cwmyers/monet.js](http://github.com/cwmyers/monet.js).

## Installation

Simply download and add to your html pages or we also support [bower]. You can also include `monet-pimp.js` which contains extra functions on the `Object.prototype` for creating monads.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="monet.js"></script>
<!-- Optionally -=>
<script type="text/javascript" src="monet-pimp.js"></script>
```
### Bower installation

```bash
bower install monet --save

# or to install a specific version
bower install monet#0.9.0-alpha.2
```

### NPM installation

```bash
npm install monet --save

# or to install a specific version
npm install monet@0.9.0-alpha.2
```

## Contents

### Maybe

The `Maybe` type is the most common way of representing *nothingness* (or the `null` type) with making the possibilities of `NullPointer` issues disappear.

`Maybe` is effectively abstract and has two concrete subtypes: `Some` (also `Just`) and `None` (also `Nothing`).

[documentation](docs/MAYBE.md)

### Either
Either (or the disjunct union) is a type that can either hold a value of type `A` or a value of type `B` but never at the same time. Typically it is used to represent computations that can fail with an error.  Think of it as a better way to handle exceptions.  We think of an `Either` as having two sides, the success is held on the right and the failure on the left.  This is a right biased either which means that `map` and `flatMap` (`bind`) will operate on the right side of the either.

[documentation](docs/EITHER.md)

### Validation
Validation is not quite a monad as it [doesn't quite follow the monad rules](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12211776/why-isnt-validation-a-monad-scalaz7), even though it has the monad methods. It that can hold either a success value or a failure value (i.e. an error message or some other failure object) and has methods for accumulating errors.  We will represent a Validation like this: `Validation[E,A]` where `E` represents the error type and `A` represents the success type.

[documentation](docs/VALIDATION.md)

### Immutable lists

An immutable list is a list that has a head element and a tail. A tail is another list.  The empty list is represented by the `Nil` constructor.  An immutable list is also known as a "cons" list.  Whenever an element is added to the list a new list is created which is essentially a new head with a pointer to the existing list.

[documentation](docs/LIST.md)

### Non Empty Lists

Much like the immutable list, a Non Empty List can never be empty.  It implements the `comonad` pattern.  It has a guaranteed head (total)
and a guaranteed (total) tail.

[documentation](docs/NEL.md)

### IO
The `IO` monad is for isolating effects to maintain referential transparency in your software.  Essentially you create a description of your effects of which is performed as the last action in your programme.  The IO is lazy and will not be evaluated until the `perform` (*alias* `run`) method is called.

[documentation](docs/IO.md)

### Reader

The `Reader` monad is a wonderful solution to inject dependencies into your functions.  There are plenty of great resources to get your
teeth into the `Reader` monad such as [these great talks](http://functionaltalks.org/tag/reader-monad/).

The `Reader` monad provides a way to "weave" your configuration throughout your programme.

[documentation](docs/READER.md)

### Free
The `Free` monad is a monad that is able to separate instructions from their interpreter.  There are many applications for this monad, and one of them is for implementing Trampolines, (which is a way to make recursion constant stack for languages that don't support tail call elimination, like JavaScript!).

Please see [Ken Scambler](http://twitter.com/KenScambler)'s [excellent talk](http://www.slideshare.net/kenbot/running-free-with-the-monads) and [example project](https://github.com/kenbot/free) to get an in-depth understanding of this very useful monad.
