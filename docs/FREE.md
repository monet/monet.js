# Free

The `Free` monad is a monad that is able to separate instructions from their interpreter. There are many applications for this monad, and one of them is for implementing Trampolines, (which is a way to make recursion constant stack for languages that don't support tail call elimination, like JavaScript!).

Please see [Ken Scambler](http://twitter.com/KenScambler)'s [excellent talk](http://www.slideshare.net/kenbot/running-free-with-the-monads) and [example project](https://github.com/kenbot/free) to get an in-depth understanding of this very useful monad.

## Creating a Free monad

The `Free` monad has two constructors, `Suspend` and `Return`, which represents the continuation of a calculation and the completion of one, respectively.

```scala
Return(a: A): Free[F[_], A]
Suspend(f: F[Free[F,A]]): Free[F[_], A]
```

```javascript
const a = Return(1)
const sum = Suspend(Identity(Return(1)))
// or
const sum = Free.liftF(Identity(1))
```

As you may see, `Return` wraps a value A, where as `Suspend`, wraps a `Functor` containing another `Free`.

### Free.liftF

```scala
Free.liftF(f: F[A]): Free[F[_], A]
```

Lifts a Functor `F` into a `Free`.

## Methods

#### map

```scala
Free[F[_], A].map(f: A => B): Free[F[_], B]
```

Performs a map across the value inside the functor.

### flatMap

**Aliases:** bind, chain

```scala
Free[F[_], A].flatMap(f: A => Free[F[_], B]): Free[F[_], B]
```

Performs a monadic bind over the `Free`.

### resume

```scala
Free[F[_], A].resume(): Either[F[Free[F[_], A]], A]
```

Evalutates a single layer in the computation, returning either a suspension or a result.

### go

```scala
Free[F[_], A].go(f: F[Free[F[_], A]] => Free[F[_], A]) : A
```

Runs the computation to the end, returning the final result, using the supplied functor `f` to extract the next `Free` from the suspension.
